# Frat.js #

Hello fellow brothers and pledges. As President of Beta Iota it's my responsibility to give you a quick outline of our here fraternity, founded in 2012 by a bunch of JavaScript hooligans.

## Initiation ##
After a successful pledging process, all candidates will be initiated.
```javascript
var frat = require('fratjs');
var Pledge = new frat.pledge();

Pledge.init();
```

## Pledging ##
Do you love Frat Rap & prototypal inheritance? Great, you'll be fine. But for all of your PHP, Python, Ruby pledges there will be extensive hazing. By the end of pledge season one thing's for sure: you won't be classy.
- David Byrd, Pledge Master
