# Frat.js #

Hello fellow brothers and pledges. As President of Beta Iota it's my responsibility to give you a quick outline of our here fraternity, founded in 2012 by a bunch of JavaScript hooligans.

## Initiation ##
After a successful pledging process, all candidates will be initiated.
```javascript
var frat = require('fratjs');
var Pledge = new frat.pledge();

Pledge.init();
```
